## Library: primjs

[PrimJS](https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs) is a QuickJS derivative optimized for the Lynx framework with better performance and Chrome DevTools support.

Version [2.11.1-rc.1](https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs) as a git submodule.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Exports: import

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- Exports a NodeJS-compatible ESModule. Cannot be imported synchronously from a NodeJS CommonJS module.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? singlefile

The WASM runtime is included directly in the JS file. Use if you run into issues with missing .wasm files when building or deploying your app.

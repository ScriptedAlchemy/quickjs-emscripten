# @jitl/primjs-singlefile-browser-release-sync

Variant with the WASM data embedded into a browser ESModule.

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/primjs-singlefile-browser-release-sync"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Library: primjs

[PrimJS](https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs) is a QuickJS derivative optimized for the Lynx framework with better performance and Chrome DevTools support.

Version [2.11.1-rc.1](https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs) as a git submodule.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Exports: browser

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- Exports a browser-compatible ESModule, designed to work in browsers and browser-like environments.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? singlefile

The WASM runtime is included directly in the JS file. Use if you run into issues with missing .wasm files when building or deploying your app.
